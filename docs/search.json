If, as it seems, the Canadian labour force is growing more educated over time, the high-skill job market will become more competitive for labour market entrants, especially those without a university degree.\n\n\n1.4.2 Key Finding: The NEET Youth Population is Too Large to Ignore\nOf the working-age youth who are not employed, most are in school. A quarter of the 30+ working-age population is NEET, as compared to 15% of working-age youth. In absolute terms, however, the number of NEET youth is still substantial (809,115).\n\nd |&gt; \n  filter(is_youth_lgl, !is.na(lf_status_neet)) |&gt; \n  group_by(lf_status_neet) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    n = sum(WEIGHT)\n  ) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  fmt_number(columns = \"n\", decimals = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlf_status_neet\nn\n\n\n\n\nEmployed\n3,518,601\n\n\nUnemployed\n325,216\n\n\nNot in the labour force\n682,119\n\n\nNot in Employment, Education, or Training (NEET)\n809,115",
