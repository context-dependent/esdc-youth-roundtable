A quarter of the 30+ working-age population is NEET, as compared to 15% of working-age youth. In absolute terms, however, the number of NEET youth is still substantial (809,115).\n\n\nShow code\nt_neet &lt;- d |&gt; \n  filter(is_youth_lgl, !is.na(lf_status_neet)) |&gt; \n  group_by(lf_status_neet) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    n = sum(WEIGHT)\n  ) \n  \nt_neet |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  fmt_number(columns = \"n\", decimals = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlf_status_neet\nn\n\n\n\n\nEmployed\n3,518,601\n\n\nUnemployed\n325,216\n\n\nNot in the labour force\n682,119\n\n\nNot in Employment, Education, or Training (NEET)\n809,115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\ndl_button(t_neet, \"neet\")\n\n\n Download data as CSV",

    "text": "1.5 Poverty and Hardship\nAccording to all of the low-income measures provided in the Census PUMF, working-age youth are more likely than their older counterparts to be live in income poverty. According to the MBM poverty line (Canada’s current official measure), 12% of working-age youth are in poverty, compared to 8% of the 30+ working-age population. In spite of this, working-age youth are no more likely to be in core housing need than their elders. Across both groups, the rate of core housing need is 7%.\n\n\nShow code\nt_pov &lt;- d |&gt; \n  filter(is_working_age_lgl) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(matches(\"LICO|LIM|LoMBM\"), HCORENEED_IND), \n    names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"value\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    var = str_to_upper(var)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(value)) |&gt;\n  group_by(is_youth_fct, var, value) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    n = sum(WEIGHT), .groups = \"drop_last\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    p = n / sum(n)\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(-n) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = is_youth_fct, values_from = p) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    censuspumf::var_labels\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(lab)\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(var)`\n\n\nShow code\nt_pov |&gt; \n  select(-var) |&gt; \n  gt(groupname_col = \"lab\", rowname_col = \"value\") |&gt; \n  fmt_percent(columns = c(2, 3), decimals = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouth (18-29)\nNot Youth (30-64)\n\n\n\n\nHousing core need indicator\n\n\nNot in core need\n93%\n93%\n\n\nIn core need\n7%\n7%\n\n\nIncome: Low-income status based on LICO-AT\n\n\nNot in low income\n91%\n95%\n\n\nIn low income\n9%\n5%\n\n\nIncome: Low-income status based on LICO-BT\n\n\nNot in low income\n89%\n93%\n\n\nIn low income\n11%\n7%\n\n\nIncome: Low-income status based on LIM-AT\n\n\nNot in low income\n90%\n91%\n\n\nIn low income\n10%\n9%\n\n\nIncome: Low-income status based on LIM-BT\n\n\nNot in low income\n88%\n89%\n\n\nIn low income\n12%\n11%\n\n\nIncome: Poverty status based on 2018-base MBM\n\n\nNot in poverty\n88%\n92%\n\n\nIn poverty\n12%\n8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\ndl_button(t_pov, \"poverty\")\n\n\n Download data as CSV",
